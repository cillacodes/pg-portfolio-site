# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website 

This is my personal developer portfolio site. The goal was to keep the tech stack simple and focus on strong fundamentals, layout structure, responsiveness, and visual clarity. Also, my main intention was to finish it. I've been meaning to create a portfolio site for years and never prioritized it. 😅

## 🎨 Design Process

I designed the layout and visual system in Figma before writing any code. My previous experience with Figma was using dev mode to translate design files to code so this was my first foray in using Figma as a designer. I used this short Youtube video as a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ1sfKIl50E

*(Note: These screenshots reflect my early design iterations as I was learning Figma. The final implementation may vary slightly as I refined spacing and responsiveness during development.)*

- Clean visual hierarchy
- Simple first, to be expanded later
- Semantic HTML structure
- Translating design → code accurately
