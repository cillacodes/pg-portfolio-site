                    I’m a software engineer with a background in front-end development and UI automation. 
                    I’m naturally curious and love learning as I go, both in my work and beyond it.
                    <br>
                    I enjoy being on collaborative teams and care about building thoughtful, 
                    accessible software (and a solid CI/CD pipeline). 
                    Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me taking photos, reading, gaming, 
                    traveling, or going to concerts! ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧
